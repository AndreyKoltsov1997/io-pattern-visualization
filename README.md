# IO pattern visualization tool.

## Purpose 
Visualizing the IO-related data via the Heat Map. What makes it unique is the additional info about the process that performs the IO operations. 

## Heatmap example

## Usage

```
$ pip install plotly 
$ python3 ./biosnoop-statistics-visualization.py <path_to_bcc_tools> <amount_of_metrics_to_collect>
```
* *<path_to_bcc_tools>*  - path to the valid BCC tools file. The implementation has been tested using BIOSNOOP;
* *<amount_of_metrics_to_collect>* - amount of metrics to collection from the script launched from <path_to_bcc_tools>;

| --help | -h | | Get available options. |
| --filepath | -f | [FILEPATH] [KIND] | Visualize data from given file. [FILEPATH] - Path to file, [KIND] - string description of the data.  |
| --execute | -e | [PATH] [AMOUNT] [KIND} | Visualize data based on the captured output of iosnoop. [PATH] - path to IOSNOOP executable, [AMOUNT] - amount of logs to process, [KIND] - string description of the data. |
