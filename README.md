## Usage

```
$ pip install plotly 
$ python3 ./biosnoop-statistics-visualization.py <path_to_bcc_tools> <amount_of_metrics_to_collect>
```
* *<path_to_bcc_tools>*  - path to the valid BCC tools file. The implementation has been tested using BIOSNOOP;
* *<amount_of_metrics_to_collect>* - amount of metrics to collection from the script launched from <path_to_bcc_tools>;

After that, the heatmap will be opened within your browser.
